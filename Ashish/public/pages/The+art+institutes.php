                  <p class="pagePostContentParagraph">headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In November 2014, EDMC was delisted from the NASDAQ in the midst of budgetary troubles, claims, and examinations.</p>
                  <p class="pagePostContentParagraph">In 2011, the Art Institutes got more prominent open investigation with the arrival of the Frontline narrative, Educating Sergeant Pantzke. In the narrative Chris Pantzke, a resigned Iraq war veteran talked about the absence of handicap administrations at the school. As per Mr. Pantzke and Frontline &quot;'Being an officer, you would prefer not to stop, you would prefer not to surrender or come up short,'&quot; he clarified. Anyhow in the wake of doing his own particular examination, Pantzke inferred that the degree he was seeking after wasn't 'justified regardless of a great deal more than the paper is justified regardless of.' And he felt he was &quot;discarding citizen cash&quot; by utilizing GI Bill stores.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="pagePostContentParagraph">EDMC's claims incorporate charges of extortion and forceful understudy recruitment and also misrepresentation identified with budgetary help qualification.</p>
